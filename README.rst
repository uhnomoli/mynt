*Another static site generator?*

With the ever growing population of static site generators, all filling a
certain need, I've yet to find one that allows the generation of anything but
the simplest of blogs.

That's where mynt comes in, being designed to give you all the features of a
CMS with none of the often rigid implementations of those features.
