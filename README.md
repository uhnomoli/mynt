# mynt

_Another static site generator?_

With the ever growing population of static site generators, more often than not I found that they either had very simplistic support for blogs or used template engines that for one reason or another irked me.

After not finding a solution I was happy with, just as any other programmer would do, I decided to roll my own and wrote mynt with the hope that others would find it useful as well.
