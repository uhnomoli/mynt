    <p><em>Another static site generator?</em></p>
    <p>With the ever growing population of static site generators, all filling a certain need, I've yet to find one that allows the generation of anything but the simplest of blogs.</p>
    <p>That's where mynt comes in, being designed to give you all the features of a CMS with none of the often rigid implementations of those features.</p>
    
    <h1>Highlights</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiple ways of getting post data, whether ordered by year and month or by tag.</li>
        <li>Automatic generation of common pages such as those for archives and tags.</li>
        <li>Freedom in the markup language and rendering engine used.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Where to start?</h1>
    <p>If you're looking to get up and running quickly, give the <a href="{{ get_url('docs/quickstart/') }}">quickstart</a> guide a read. Otherwise, if you're familiar with static site generators in general, the other more reference style doc pages may be a better jumping off point for you. You can also check out what <a href="{{ get_url('community/powering/') }}">people are making with mynt</a> if you prefer working off of examples as many are open source.</p>
    
    <h1>I have a question! / How can I help?</h1>
    <p>There are two main places to find other people messing around with mynt: <a href="https://github.com/Anomareh/mynt">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=mynt">IRC</a>. Feel free to use whichever you're the most comfortable with. I only ask if you choose IRC and have a question, please give me a bit <em>(more than a few hours)</em> to see it and help you!</p>
